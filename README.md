# .NET Sample 
We are connecting a microphone directly with the speech recognitin service from DeepGram.

What we need to use the DeepGram Servce:
a deepgram account and a project
and the NUGET apckages for NAudio and the Deepgram SDK

The package for DeepGram is only available as a .NET core package.
Therefore you can use it only in a console or in MAUI program with the Visual Studio 17.2 Preview
